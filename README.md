# Castle Authentication Nodes

The Castle authentication nodes lets administrators integrate Castle risk tools into an AM Intelligent Access trees.

## Usage

To deploy these nodes, download the jar from the releases tab on github
[here](https://github.com/ForgeRock/Castle-Auth-Tree-Nodes/releases/latest). Next, copy the jar into the
../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib directory where AM is deployed. Restart the web container to pick up the
new nodes. The nodes will then appear in the authentication trees components palette.

### Castle Profiler Node
This node tags the AM login page with the Castle JS to collect information about the event.

#### Castle Profiler Node Configuration
* **App ID** - Castle App ID.
* **Profiler URI** - Castle client side CDN link.

### Castle Risk Node
This node makes a request the Castle Risk API to retrieve a policy decision about the user session.

#### Castle Risk Node Configuration

* **API Secret** - A secret that will be used for authentication purposes.
* **Event** - The Castle Event type.
* **Allowlisted Headers** - A comma-separated list of strings representing HTTP headers that will get passed to the 
  context object with each call to the Castle API, unless they are denylisted. If not set or empty all headers will 
  be sent.
* **Denylisted Headers** - A comma-separated list of strings representing HTTP headers that will never get passed to 
  the context object.
* **Timeout** - An integer that represents the time in milliseconds after which a request fails.
* **Authenticate Failover Strategy** - The strategy that will be used when a request to the /v1/authenticate 
  endpoint of the Castle API fails.
* **Base URL** - The base endpoint of the Castle API without any relative path.
* **Log HTTP Requests** - Log HTTP Requests
* **Mail Attribute** - The ForgeRock email attribute.

### Castle Action Node
This node analyzes the response from the Castle Risk Node and routes to the <code>Allow</code>,
<code>Challenge</code> or <code>Deny</code> node outcomes.

### Castle Score Node
This node analyzes the response from the Castle Risk Node and checks to see if the risk score is
above the configured value.

#### Castle Score Node Configuration

* **Score Threshold** - Castleâ€™s APIs return a numerical risk score between zero and one. Low-risk events are scored 
  at or near zero, and high-risk events are scored at or near one.

### Castle Signal Node
This node analyzes the response from the Castle Risk Node and checks to see if an individual signal
has been returned. These signal correspond to Castle Signals found [here](https://docs.castle.io/v1/reference/signals/).

#### Castle Signal Node Configuration
* **Signal Outcomes** - A list of Signals that you would like to check for from a Castle Risk
  evaluation. When a Signal is added to this list, a new outcome will presented on the node. The node will
  iterate through the configured Signals until a Reason code is found and will return that outcome. Otherwise
  the <code>None Triggered</code> outcome will be returned.

### Castle Approve Device Node
This node calls the Castle Approve Device API to update the users device with approval. 
session.

#### Castle Approve Device Node Configuration

* **API Secret** - A secret that will be used for authentication purposes.
* **Base URL** - The base endpoint of the Castle API without any relative path.
